# Yarn Relative Imports

## Info
this is a skeleton of an ionic 2 app that `yarn` cannot install but `npm` can

in our case `src/commons` is a submodule that manages our common dependancies for our app.


## Steps to reproduce
- install ionic globally `npm install -g ionic@2.1.4`
    - (optional) install cordova
- clone this repo to your machine
- run `yarn`
    - yarn will fail with the error reported below
- run `npm i`
    - npm can install this
- run `ionic serve`
